                        <h4>Random Forest Classification</h4>
                        <p>Analysis of the Northern Great Plains Research Labratory(NOGP) NEON biderectional surface reflectance data product. Training data was collected to develop a land-cover taxonomy. The data is trained using a random forest classification using red, blue, green, and near-infrared spectral bands. The results show a geometry sorted into developed, herbacoues, water, and cropland areas.
                            The second image displayes a co-spectral chart of randomly selected points in the geometry. Using NIR and Red spectral bands the plot succesfully differentiates between soil, vegatation, and water based on the points position in the plot. This is useful for further training methods such as min distance to means, parralel piped, and maximum likelihood classifiers. Google Earth Engine was used for this analysis.</p>

                        <h4>How Can Hydrogen Blending Overcome Transmission Grid Deficiencies by Leveraging Renewable Electrical Generators in the Interconnection Queue
</h4>
                            <pre>
Commitments to reducing emissions and promoting clean energy have been made by the United States federal government as well as state legislatures, focusing on a robust clean electricity grid capable of supporting the nation's growing demand. The Biden Administration has set a goal of 100% clean electricity within the next decade but is facing an aging transmission grid that cannot handle the increased load required for this transformation. The Department of Energy estimates that regional transmission grids must increase capacity by 64% to meet energy needs over the next decade (U.S. Department of Energy). For context, the nation's transmission lines have expanded at a rate of just 1% per year for the past decade (CNBC). New grid infrastructure is also tremendously time-consuming. Expansions can take up to 15 years to complete due to lengthy permitting and cost allocation processes. This struggle to increase capacity is evident when examining the transmission interconnection queue for newly built renewable energy projects. As of 2023, the U.S. has almost 2 million megawatts of solar, wind, and battery storage capacity waiting to connect to the energy grid (Decarbonization). High queue withdrawal rates—resulting from an approximately four-year wait—mean that only 19% of the connections in the queue have been finalized over the past decade (Decarbonization). This significant roadblock to clean energy initiatives stems from a challenging transmission expansion process, which is hindered by site and permitting difficulties, poor financial incentives, and cost allocation issues. The DOE has highlighted the need not only to reduce congestion but also to increase interregional transmission connections.
A renewable energy grid requires a shift in design doctrine, moving from a one-way flow of electricity from large-scale fossil-fuel power generators to consumers. A clean grid would not only feature large-scale generators but also many small power sources, such as rooftop solar, resulting in two-way power flow as these small connections feed energy back into the grid. Furthermore, large-scale renewable energy generators are often decentralized, as solar and wind resources require space far from concentrated consumer populations. This decentralization necessitates more transmission infrastructure, as wind farms in the Midwest or solar fields in the desert must be able to transmit power to distant population centers. Currently, this interregional transmission infrastructure does not exist. Median capacity expansion projections indicate that interregional transfer capacity must grow by 412% to meet high energy growth estimates over the next decade (U.S. Department of Energy). These expansions will require massive investments from utilities, which will directly impact customers through rate hikes. According to the Edison Electric Institute, in 2020 utilities spent $132.7 billion on capital expenditures, excluding transmission-related expenses. The transmission expansion required to meet the goals of a fully renewable grid could cost as much as $504 billion (Loris). 
The greatest hurdles to a clean electricity grid are congestion and a lack of interregional connections. However, the nation relies not only on the electricity grid to transport energy but also on a robust natural gas infrastructure that delivers 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to 70 million consumers (U.S. Energy Information Administration). These 3 million miles of pipeline can offer a solution to efficiently transporting clean energy across the nation through hydrogen blending. Hydrogen, as an energy carrier, can be produced from any energy source, including renewable energy like solar or wind. The need for a carbon-free energy carrier is essential to decarbonization efforts, particularly for heavy industries reliant on combustible fuel. Hydrogen has been hailed as a critical component of a carbon-neutral world but has been limited by a lack of infrastructure to produce and transport the energy.
Hydrogen production in the United States already exists on an industrial scale but is primarily performed through carbon-heavy steam methane reforming. In this process, high-pressure steam is exposed to methane sourced from natural gas, producing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and CO2 (U.S. Energy Information Administration). However, clean hydrogen production is possible through electrical electrolysis. Although electrolysis is energy-intensive, it offers a carbon-free approach if the electricity is sourced from renewable generators. Hydrogen produced via electrolysis currently costs between $4 and $7 per kilogram, compared to $1 to $2.50 per kilogram through steam methane reforming. The high price of electricity required for electrolysis could be reduced by utilizing renewable generators in the interconnection queue. Leveraging the vast amounts of renewable energy in limbo to create clean hydrogen could alleviate grid congestion while jump-starting the hydrogen economy. Clean hydrogen could then be transported via the nation’s vast natural gas network through hydrogen blending. This would not only ease the interconnection queue but also overcome the lack of interregional access to clean energy. The transmission grid’s critical issues cannot be solved in time to meet the carbon targets set by state legislatures and the Biden administration. However, hydrogen blending sourced from renewable energy in the interconnection queue presents an innovative solution to clean energy.
Geospatial analysis shows that a significant portion of counties with renewable projects in the queue also have existing natural gas infrastructure, indicating strong potential for hydrogen blending.

                        <p>In 2022, I interned with NC State's Intelligent Structures and Systems Research Lab (ISSRL), studying the annihilation of Limited Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) using vortex shedding generated by an on-wing bluff body. This research involved designing an airfoil in Fusion 360, which was 3D-printed and used to create a prototype for wind tunnel experiments.
                            The results were collected using a laser vibrometer and analyzed in MATLAB to understand how an upwind bluff body could be used to stabilize an airfoil undergoing LCOs. This internship provided me with hands-on experience in computational research and general lab work.</p>
